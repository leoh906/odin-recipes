    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Make the Roux:</b> In a large heavy bottom stock pot combine flour and oil. Cook on medium-low heat,stirring constantly fir 30-45 minutes.This part takes patience--when it's finished it should be as dark as chocolate and have a soft,"cookie dough" like consistency. Be careful not to let it burn! Feel free to add a little more flour or oil as needed to reach this consistency. </li>
        <li><b>Brown the Sausage:</b>In a seperate skillet on medium-high heat place the sausage slices in one layer in the pan. Brown them well on one side (2-3 minutes) and then use a fork to flip each over onto the other side to brown.Remove to a plate</li>
        <li><b>Cook the vegetables in broth:</b>Add 1/2 cup of the chicken broth to the hot skillet that had the sausage to deglaze the pan.Pour the broth and drippings into your large soup pot.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 5 1/2 cups of chicken broth.Add veggies,parsley,and roux to the pot and stir well.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil for 5-7 minutes,or until the vegetables are slightly tender.(Skim off any foam that may rise to the top of the pot.) Stir in cajun seasoning, to taste.</li>
        <li><b>Add meat:</b>Add chicken,sausage,and shrimp</li>
        <li><b>Taste and serve:</b>At this point taste it and and add more seasonings to your liking--salt,pepper,chicken bullion paste,garlic,more Joe's stuff or more chicken broth--until you reach the perfect flavor.Serve warm over rice.(Tastes even better the next day!)</li>
    </ol>
